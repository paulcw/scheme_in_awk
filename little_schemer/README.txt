These are code examples from the text The Little Schemer.
Note that these are not exact transcriptions; I'm using that text
to generate use cases for the interpreter.  So it's not going to be
an exact match and it's not meant to be useful educational material
or anything like that.  There may also be extra stuff, or divergences
so that different aspects of the code is tested.
